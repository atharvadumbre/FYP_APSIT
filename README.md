## Project : An Education web portal for Indian Sign Language

Our Project "signGuru" aims to educate normal people in Indian Sign language which would help them in communicating with the deaf and mute community. This would make the deaf and mute people more comfortable in everyday life.

The website will contain various lessons on different characters and numbers in Indian Sign language along with, quizzes and tests to validate the skills acquired. The portal would have a fixed learning path for learners which would make sure they won't miss anything on the knowledge part.
